# Billing Application

This is a billing application developed using the Django web framework. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing and generating bills for your customers. The application is designed to be flexible and easily customizable to suit your specific billing needs.

## Features

1. User Authentication: The application allows users to register and log in using their credentials. This ensures secure access to the billing system and allows for role-based permissions.

2. Customer Management: You can easily add, edit, and delete customer information. The application stores relevant details such as customer name, address, contact information, and any other additional information you require.

3. Product/Service Management: The application allows you to manage your products or services. You can add, edit, and delete items from your catalog, along with their prices and other relevant details.

4. Billing: The core functionality of the application is generating bills for your customers. You can create bills by selecting a customer, adding the products or services they purchased, and calculating the total amount due.

5. Bill Generation and Printing: Once a bill is created, you can generate a printable version in PDF format. This allows you to easily save and distribute bills to your customers.

6. Payment Tracking: The application provides the ability to track payments made by customers. You can mark bills as paid, partially paid, or unpaid, and keep a record of the payment status.

7. Reporting: Generate reports to gain insights into your billing activities. You can view sales summaries, customer payment history, and other relevant statistics.
